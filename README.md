# BeoCreate Elements
BeoCreate Elements is an open-design sound system based on [BeoCreate 4-Channel Amplifier](http://www.hifiberry.com/beocreate/). Whilst the software will remain available for those interested *as is*, all future development is happening in [Beocreate 2](https://github.com/bang-olufsen/create) project, which will eventually implement most (if not all) features from this project.

You can read the origin story for Beocreate Elements in my [Master's thesis](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/36081).

## Features
#### General
- Beautiful web-based user interface
- Simple setup of Wi-Fi networks on a Raspberry Pi
- Support for BeoSound Essence Remote (coming later)
#### Easy setup for BeoCreate Elements
- Generates correction filters for the system based on enclosure dimensions (concept)
#### Advanced sound adjustments for any loudspeaker
- Independent left/right/mono routing for all channels
- Flexible and independent high-pass/low-pass filters for all channels (crossover)
- Adjustable equaliser filters for all channels (10 per channel)

## Technical Information
### Sound Adjustments
#### Requirements
To use the advanced sound adjustment features, a special "general-purpose" DSP program has to be loaded in the SigmaDSP processor of BeoCreate 4-Channel Amplifier, and the program's *ParamAddress.dat* file (generated by SigmaStudio at compile time) to be in */home/pi/dsp/* directory. A future version of the software can install the right DSP program with one touch.

## Beocreate Core

Beocreate Core was an enclosure designed for Beocreate 4-Channel Amplifier as part of the Elements project.

The models for building the enclosure are available **for personal use** within the Beocreate Core directory:

- Top case in STEP format, intended to be machined out of 8 mm sheet of aluminium. Screw bosses are intended for M3 threads.
- Bottom case in STEP format, intended to be machined out of Hi-MACS, Corian, wood, MDF or other similar material.
- Mask for the connectors in DXF format, intended to be laser-cut out of 3 mm acrylic.

The models correspond to the final version, whose design and assembly are further described in the thesis.

If you build a Beocreate Core, I would love to hear from you. Please @ me on Twitter ([@tuomas\_h](https://twitter.com/tuomas_h)) with any questions and/or tag me on Instagram ([@tuomas\_h](https://instagr.am/tuomas_h)).
