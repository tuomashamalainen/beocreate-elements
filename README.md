BeoCreate Elements is an open-design sound system based on [BeoCreate 4-Channel Amplifier](http://www.hifiberry.com/beocreate/). This software package builds on *beocreate_essentials* developed for  [Project ReCreate](https://github.com/bang-olufsen/create), adding advanced graphical user interface for equaliser filters and other sound adjustments.
